A custom Trello design to coordinate sales with various departments in a Used Car Sales company
<!-- More -->
Many Trello users started with Trello as the would with **POST-IT**. Users would create cards and move them across the board -  adding labels, due dates, checklist, description, members etc.

Above was how a UK client in the used car sales business had done it. With automation, without using any custom fields, the client is now able to add in cars to their stock and activate a job care in the workshop board for an inspection. The progression of the job through different stages of in the workshop can be viewed by hovering over the “Jobs” checklist item. When the inspection is completed, the “Cars” board item representing the job is marked as completed.

Following the inspection, more work may be needed in other departments and these are triggered from the car card and sent to different departments. On each department the job card is moved, automatically, to the appropriate list. The completion process, as described for inspection, works across all the department boards. They have 6 other departments for jobs to be coordinated.

The above design allows for department specific automation or work progression to be managed separately from the main car sales board.

When a car is marked “Sold” all incomplete job cards are marked and moved to the top of their respective list so that work on the car is given priority. This minimise the need to communicate the status across departments. 

The client will also use Dashcard and Swim Lanes power ups to allow them to manage both sales and jobs across the  enterprise. 

This design pattern can be easily replicated across other similar businesses.
