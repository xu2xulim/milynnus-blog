#**From idea to design - a software product development example**

<!-- More -->
â€Œ

There is a useful document from Trello "Creating and managing task dependencies" wil teach you how to use Trello automation to create and manage task dependencies. It is a place to start on your journey to be Trello automation expert. You will see that the adaptation of the design principles and how these are put together in this case study to be quite different. It only serves to illustrate that client requirements can be very unique and sufficient time should be allocated to work on understanding the requirements before attempting to create a design,

How do you take an idea like a software product development cycle

to a solution like this?

In this case study, I will show the key elements of design that will allow collaboration among team members around 2 week sprints around each task as represented by e.g. Product name->Color pallete->Logo

For this to happen, team member will work on **Sprint** cards to progress them from the time it is created to when the work item is completed by moving it to _Done._

Before that, a template card to create the **Epic** card. This design allows for different software product to be worked on from the same board. Each Epic card has the the 3 phases (Project) which will be used to create **Project** card.

Similarly, each Project card will have the task associated with it to create the **Task** card.

Finally, from each Task card two week **Sprint** cards can be created with both start date and due dates. When a Sprint card is moved to _Done_ the status on the Task card is also checked.

The similar design pattern can also be adopted at the Task and or Project levels as defined by your project management system. This will be depend on how work is being managed in your organisation.
